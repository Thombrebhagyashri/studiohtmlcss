                    <blockquote>
                        "Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever ... It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything."<span>-Aaron Siskind</span>
                
                        Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication. Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.

                        <h3>The best and most experienced photographers know that the success of portrait photography is down to teamwork.</h3>
                        <p>Over the last few years working in professional portrait photography I have learnt that the success of my endeavours is not solely down to me. It is all about teamwork: ‘a co-ordinated effort on the part of a group of persons acting together as a team in the interests of a common cause’.</p>

                        <p>Working in a photography team can get tricky, but it's rewarding too! You get to brainstorm creative and business ideas, celebrate your wins with your team members, turn your big business vision into reality, and so much more. But to really reap the benefits of having a team, it's important to have a plan in place.</p>
